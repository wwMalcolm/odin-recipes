        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary leaves, crumbled</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>Pour in the wine; stir, scraping the bottom of the pot to release any browned bits from the bottom. Stir in the tomatoes and stock. Bring to a simmer; cook until meat is very tender and the sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes.</li>
